This work is ported from FixMatch pytorch implementation [repo](https://github.com/kekmodel/FixMatch-pytorch) by Jungdae Kim. For more details about FixMatch, have a look at this excellent blog post [The Illustrated FixMatch for Semi-Supervised Learning](https://amitness.com/2020/03/fixmatch-semi-supervised/). FixMatch paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685).
